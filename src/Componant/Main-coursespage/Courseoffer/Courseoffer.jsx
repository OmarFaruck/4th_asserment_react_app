              <p>Before delineating specific trends that are 
                foreseen over the next several years, letâ€™s begin by speculating 
                where all of the various changes in education and society will 
                eventually lead us. If we are talking about what schooling will 
                look like in the year 2055, or fifty years from now, the answer 
                may be an easy one - and this paper becomes much simpler 
                and certainly a lot shorter.</p>
